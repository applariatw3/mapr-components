README for building the MAPR Core Image used with applariat

MAPR Core is used to create a base docker container image which will be used to create component resources for MAPR.  There are 2 key reasons for using the 
base image concept, instead of building each component from scratch.

1.  The core image is quite large and it signifcantly reduces build time by using the core image.
2.  It provides a common server model that is consistent and repeatable for all components.

The MAPR Core image is built with the following:
 - Starts from a base OS image - seperated into distinct Dockerfiles
 - Installs all MAPR dependent packages
 - Creates a set of SSH keys for the mapr admin user to enable passwordless SSH
 - Copies common files and scripts 
 - Installs the core MAPR packages based on the Core and MEP versions provided


 To build the core image(s):

 Run the docker-build.sh script:

 All options must be provided in the order specified, but are optional as defaults are specified.
 CORE_VERSION=MAPR Core Version (default: 6.0.0)
 MEP_VERSION=MAPR MEP Version (default: 4.0.0)
 BASE_OS=the tag name on the end of the Dockerfiles, the image will be built from that Dockerfile (default: ubuntu14)
 REPO_ACCOUNT=the account identifier of the docker repo (default: maprtech)
 IMAGE_NAME=name of the image (default: mapr-core)
 IMAGE_TAG=the tag for the image (default: $CORE_VERSION_$MEP_VERSION_$OS_TAG)
 PUSH_TO_HUB=1 to push to remote docker repo (must be logged in), 0 to keep image local only (default: 0)

 To modify any of these defaults, just update the docker-build.sh script

 ./docker-build.sh  [CORE_VERSION  MEP_VERSION  BASE_OS  REPO_ACCOUNT  IMAGE_NAME  IMAGE_TAG  PUSH_TO_HUB]

 example: build MAPR Core for 5.2.2, 3.0.2 on ubuntu14

 ./docker-build.sh 5.2.2 3.0.2

 example: build MAPR Core for 5.2.2, 3.0.2 on centos6
