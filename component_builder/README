README for building the individual MAPR Component Images used with applariat

The individual MAPR Component images are built on top of the MAPR Core image. The intent is to build a group of component images
that can be combined to create MAPR Clusters.  Instead of grouping several components into a single image, we follow the intent
of containers by isolating services into their own container object.  However since every image is built from the same core image
they all inherit any needed common capabilities (i.e. passwordless ssh)

To simplify the individual component images, they are all built from this single project

The key features of this project include:
 - Multiple components can be built and pushed to a docker repo by running the image-builds.sh and either passing command line arguments
   or adjusting the all array set by default
 - Which packages to install for a given component is controlled in the build.sh script based on arguments passed into the Dockerfile
 - The scripts folder can be used to overwrite or test changes to the same scripts built into the core image without having to rebuild core
 - Information needed for creating the MAPR cluster is passed in via environment variables at runtime, no cluster configuration
   takes place during the build process
 - All component images use a common entrypoint.sh script which preconfigures each component into the designated cluster.
 - Currently clusters are being created using a "disk file" created at image startup.

 To build the component image(s):

 Open and edit the image-builds.sh script (optional):
  - Modify the components you want built in the all array at the top of the script, it is setup to easily comment out components
    you want to skip
 
 Run the image-builds.sh script:
  - if you run the image-builds.sh with either the "all" or zero arguments, it will build components based on the elements in the all() array
  - you can provide specific flags for components, which are listed inside the script or by using the -h argument:

 ./image-builds.sh  [all | list of component flags (zk cldb-mcs yarn rm drill ...)] [-h]

 example: build all component images

 ./image-builds.sh or ./image-builds.sh all

 example: build only zookeeper component

./image-builds.sh zk
